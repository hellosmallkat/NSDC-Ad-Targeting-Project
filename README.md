# Ad Targeting & Click Prediction

**Machine Learning Project**

Welcome! 
This project focuses on predicting whether a user will click on an online advertisement using real-world advertising data. Online ads are a major revenue driver for businesses, but understanding what drives user engagement remains a challenge. This project applies **data science and machine learning techniques** to help marketers make smarter, data-driven decisions.

##  About This Project

In today's digital marketing landscape, businesses rely heavily on targeted advertising to improve engagement and conversion rates. In this project, we analyze user behavior and advertising features to build a **predictive model** that estimates the likelihood that a user will click an ad.

The project walks through the **full machine learning workflow**, from data cleaning and exploration to model training and evaluation, making it a strong practical learning experience and portfolio piece.


##  Dataset
